    <!-- Object , class , inheritance 
    object = in this world every thing is a object (living things and non living things)example , kajal(girls), ertica(Car) 
   //Spaghettic-code(code whiche write in unstructure)
   
   In Oops concept we group function and variable in block Called Class
   //Encapsulation means wrapping up data and member function (Method)together into a single unit i.e class.
   Abstraction = Abstarticon is the proccess of showing only essential /necessury feature of an entity/object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant information . for example to open your TV we only have a power button , it is nit required to understand how infra-red waves ae getting genrated in TV remort control.
